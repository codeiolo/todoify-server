# Todoify Server

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Intro

Todoify Server, a simple to-do with categories, REST API built with NodeJS, [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express/), [JWT](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken), and [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose).
Authenticated users can only get and manipulate categories and to-do's that matches the user id.

Stay tuned for updates in a near future! :D

## Requirements

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Install

Start off by downloading Todoify Server

```
git clone https://github.com/luxwarp/todoify-server.git
```

cd in to your todoify-server folder and copy .env.example to .env 

```
cp .env.example .env
```

edit your new .env file and change all information to match your own settings

```
nano .env 
```

save .env file and then install dependencies

```
npm install
``` 

Then run index.js with

```
npm start
```

You should now see in your console that Server is running. Todoify server runs with help of [Supervisor](https://github.com/petruisfan/node-supervisor) so if the server crashes while running it restarts automatically.

If Todoify server loses connection to your MongoDB server it will try to reconnect every 5 second until you kill the Todoify server manually or it gets connected again.

By default Todoify server does not use HTTPS, the easiest way to get your connection encrypted is by using a web server like Nginx or Apache and proxy your traffic from your domain via SSL and down to Todoify server that runs on it's own port.
